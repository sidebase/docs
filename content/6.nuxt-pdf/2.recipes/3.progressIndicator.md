# Progress indicator

Sometimes it may be helpful to include a loading indicator while the component is being exported. This can be added by introducing a new ref that updates its state according to the progress.

```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="isExporting">
    Exporting PDF... Please wait a minute.
  </div>
  <div ref="pdfSection">
    This is my demo content.
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
const { $exportToPDF } = useNuxtApp()

const pdfSection = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null)
const isExporting = ref(false)

const print = async (element: HTMLElement, options) => {
  isExporting.value = true
  await $exportToPDF(element, options)
  isExporting.value = false
}
</script>
```
