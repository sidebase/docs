# Node setup

If this is the first time you run a `npm` / `node` app on your setup:

1. Install the `node` version manager `nvm` by running:
    ```sh
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
2. Install the required `node` and `npm` version:
    ```sh
    # uses existing `.nvmrc`-file to install required version
    nvm install
    ```
3. Use the required `node` and `npm` version:
    ```sh
    # uses `.nvmrc` to use required version
    nvm use
    # ALTERNATIVE: make node 16.14.2 your default node version (version copied from `.nvmrc`, check there for most up to date node version)
    nvm alias default 16.14.2
    ```
4. Install a code editor (recommended: VS Code), [get it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. Uninstall or disable the old Vue VS Code extension `Vetur`, else conflicts may arise between `volar` and `Vetur`
6. Install the `volar` extension to support `vue`, `nuxt` and `typescript` development help

7. Enable "take over mode" for volar for this project.
    - documented here: https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471
    - for VS Code:
        1. Run (CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P): Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions
        2. Find "TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features"
        3. Right click and select "disable for workspace"
        4. Reload the editor
        5. A message "Take over mode enabled" (or similar) should appear
8. Go to the [top of this section](#commands) and execute commands (start with `npm i` to get all packages!)

If you have type-problems after running `npm i` for the first time:
- Ensure you have `vetur` disabled or uninstalled (see above),
- Ensure you have the builtin `typescript` extention of VS Code disabled (see above),
- Reload the `vue` volar server (VS Code command: "Volar: Restart Vue Server")
- Close and re-open the file you have problems with

If none of this works, file an issue (preferrably with a reproduction) [here](https://github.com/sidebase/sidebase/issues/new/choose).
