# Breakpoint debugging

1. Open the command palette (CMD / CTRL + SHIFT + P)
2. Select "Debug: JavaScript Debug Terminal"
3. Run any `npm` command inside `app/`, e.g.: `npm run test`
4. Your code editor colors should change a bit (e.g.: to orange) while executing the command, the left side should show deep execution insights
5. Set breakpoints (click left of line count in editor - red dot should appear) - the debugger will automatically work and stop at them and allow you to inspect variables
6. Run a command that runs the code you set breakpoints at, e.g., `npm run test`
