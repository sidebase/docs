# Nuxt Auth

`nuxt-auth` is a module we made ourselves. It wraps the very popular NextAuth.js library and brings its 12k github star power to the Nuxt 3 ecosystem. With `nuxt-auth` you can implement authentication via most possible OAuth providers in a few seconds.

We've written a full documentation for `nuxt-auth`, [please check it out here](https://sidebase.io/nuxt-auth/getting-started).
