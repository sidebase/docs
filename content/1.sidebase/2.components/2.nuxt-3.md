# Nuxt 3

[Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) is great - it has kept its promise of progressiveness and simplicity for web app development. It also has a rich ecosystem of libraries, modules and a sprawling developer community. [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) wraps Vue 3 to help us productive Vue 3 quicker than ever before: Fullstack web Apps, Static Websites, PWAs and more are all possible with Nuxt 3. Nuxt also optimizes all of these modes heavily to provide the best user-experience (UX) and developer-experience (DX). Nuxt 3 prides itself with being "The Intuitive Web Framework" - and we agree!

Nuxt 3 is what "launches" your app. So you are already using it after running:
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn run dev
```
::


You will see an output like this (if everything went well):
```bash
Nuxi 3.0.0
Nuxt 3.0.0 with Nitro 1.0.0

  > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  > Network:  http://192.168.8.118:3000/
  > Network:  http://[fd60:aaef:97c3:d900:ce:722e:a03c:dc0]:3000/
```

When you open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you will see the sidebase-start-screen. It is very minimal - don't let that shock you. It is meant to be removed as one of your first actions and be replaced with your own beautiful idea.
