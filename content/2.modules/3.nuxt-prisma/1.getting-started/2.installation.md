# Installation

To setup a Nuxt 3 project with Prisma ORM use the [sidebase CLI](/sidebase/welcome):
::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create sidebase@latest
```
```bash [yarn]
# Note: Due to a known problem with `yarn`, it is not possible to force yarn to always use `@latest`: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6587
yarn create sidebase
```
::

In the CLI you can either the Merino stack or the Cheviot stack - if you choose the Merino stack, select "Prisma ORM" when the CLI asks you for what modules to use. And done!
