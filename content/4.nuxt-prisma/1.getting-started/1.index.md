# Introduction

`nuxt-prisma` is an open source Nuxt layer that provides an prisma ORM integration for Nuxt 3 applications.

`nuxt-prisma`:
::list{type="success"}
- Exports `usePrisma` which allows you to access a `PrismaClient` on the server side, the client is setup following [prisma best practices](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management)
- Exports `resetDatabase`, a testing utility that resets your database, this can be useful for testing, e.g., in a `beforeEach` hook
- Exports `setAbsoluteSqliteDatabaseUrlForPrisma`, a testing and development utility that can be useful when using Prisma with the `sqlite` provider

## Simplify `nuxt-prisma` integration with sidebase

We developed `nuxt-prisma` as a layer for `sidebase`, the productive Nuxt 3 starter. `sidebase` already integrates `nuxt-prisma` for you and also sets up additional helpers, like running `npx prisma generate` automatically for development and building.

Using sidebase which includes `nuxt-prisma` out of the box is easy, just run:
```sh
npx nuxi@latest init -t community/sidebase
```
